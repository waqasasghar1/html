        <h2>Cloud Native Computing</h2>
        The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is a Linux Foundation project
        that was founded in 2015 to help advance container technology[1] and align the 
        tech industry around its evolution.

        <h3>Blockchain Computing</h3>
        Blockchain is a record-keeping technology designed to make it impossible to
        hack the system or forge the data stored on it, thereby making it secure and
        immutable. It is a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT), a digital
        system for recording transactions and related data in multiple places at the same time.

        <h4>Internet of Things</h4>
        The Internet of Things (IoT) describes physical objects (or groups of such objects) 
        with sensors, processing ability, software, and other technologies that connect
        and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks
