    <h2>Blockchain Computing</h2>
    <p id="bcc">
        Blockchain is a record-keeping technology designed to make it impossible to
        hack the system or forge the data stored on it, thereby making it secure and
        immutable. It is a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT), a digital
        system for recording transactions and related data in multiple places at the same time.
    </p>
    <h2>Internet of Things</h2>
    <p id="iot">
        The Internet of Things (IoT) describes physical objects (or groups of such objects)

        and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks.
